## 4. Technology Overview {#technology-overview}

### Ethereum Blockchain

Pet Coin AI is built on the Ethereum blockchain, a well-established
blockchain that provides several key advantages:

- **Security:** Ethereum is one of the most secure and battle-tested
  blockchains in the world, with a robust network of validators ensuring
  transaction integrity.
- **Smart Contract Capabilities:** Ethereum\'s advanced smart contract
  functionality allows for complex operations and secure token
  mechanics.
- **Wide Adoption:** Ethereum has the largest ecosystem of decentralized
  applications, exchanges, and tools, providing Pet Coin AI with
  numerous integration opportunities.
- **Ongoing Improvements:** Ethereum\'s roadmap includes significant
  scalability and efficiency improvements, ensuring Pet Coin AI can grow
  with the network.

### Smart Contract Architecture

Pet Coin AI\'s smart contracts are built using Ethereum\'s Solidity
programming language, which provides enhanced security and
functionality. The core functionality includes:

- **Automatic Fee Distribution:** Smart contracts that automatically
  allocate transaction fees to charity wallets, burn addresses, and
  holder rewards.
- **Transparent Charity Donations:** Verifiable on-chain transactions to
  approved charity wallet addresses.
- **Token Burning Mechanism:** Irreversible removal of tokens from
  circulation to create deflationary pressure.
- **Holder Rewards Distribution:** Proportional redistribution of
  rewards based on holding percentage.

### Security Features

Pet Coin AI prioritizes security through several measures:

- **Audited Code:** All smart contracts undergo rigorous third-party
  security audits before deployment.
- **Multi-signature Wallets:** Critical operations require approval from
  multiple authorized parties.
- **Time-locked Contracts:** Certain functions are subject to time
  delays to prevent malicious actions.
- **Transparent Operations:** All contract code is open-source and
  verifiable on-chain.


## 5. Tokenomics {#tokenomics}

### Token Distribution

Pet Coin AI has a total supply of 1,000,000,000,000 (1 trillion) PETAI
tokens, distributed as follows:

- **Public Sale:** 40% (400 billion tokens)
- **Liquidity Pool:** 15% (200 billion tokens)
- **Development Fund:** 10% (100 billion tokens)
- **Marketing:** 10% (100 billion tokens)
- **Team:** 10% (100 billion tokens, vested over 1 year)
- **Charity Wallet:** 5% (50 billion tokens, initial seeding)

### Transaction Fee Structure

Each Pet Coin AI transaction includes a 3.5% fee, distributed as
follows:

- **Charity Allocation:** 1% is automatically directed to verified
  animal welfare organizations
- **Token Burn:** 0.5% is permanently removed from circulation
- **Holder Rewards:** 2% is redistributed to existing token holders
  proportional to their holdings

### Burn Mechanism

The 0.5% burn on every transaction creates a deflationary pressure on
the token supply. As more transactions occur, more tokens are
permanently removed from circulation, potentially increasing the value
of remaining tokens over time.

The burn mechanism is implemented through a one-way function that sends
tokens to a verifiably inaccessible address, ensuring that burned tokens
can never re-enter circulation.


## 6. Rewards Program {#rewards-program}

### Holder Benefits

All Pet Coin AI holders receive benefits proportional to their holdings:

- **Automatic Rewards:** 2% of all transaction volume is redistributed
  to holders
- **Governance Rights:** Voting power on charity selection and project
  development decisions
- **Community Access:** Membership in the Pet Coin AI community with
  exclusive content and events

### Staking Rewards

In addition to transaction-based rewards, Pet Coin AI will implement a
staking program in Phase 2, offering enhanced rewards for holders who
commit to locking their tokens for specified periods:

- **30-Day Staking:** Additional 2% APY
- **90-Day Staking:** Additional 5% APY
- **180-Day Staking:** Additional 10% APY
- **365-Day Staking:** Additional 15% APY

### Loyalty Tiers

Pet Coin AI implements a tiered loyalty system based on token holdings:

- **Standard Tier:** Any holder
- **Silver Tier:** Holders with \$100+ worth of tokens
- **Gold Tier:** Holders with \$500+ worth of tokens
- **Platinum Tier:** Holders with \$1,000+ worth of tokens
- **Diamond Tier:** Holders with \$10,000+ worth of tokens

Higher tiers receive additional benefits, including early access to new
features, enhanced customer support, and exclusive access to the Pet
Coin AI app (Platinum tier and above).


## 7. Charity Mechanism {#charity-mechanism}

### Supported Organizations

Pet Coin AI supports a diverse range of animal welfare organizations,
including:

- Spay and neuter programs
- Wildlife rehabilitation centers
- Veterinary care for low-income pet owners
- Animal rights advocacy groups

All supported organizations undergo a thorough vetting process to ensure
legitimacy, financial responsibility, and alignment with Pet Coin AI\'s
mission.

### Donation Distribution

The 1% charity allocation from each transaction is distributed to
supported organizations based on:

- Community voting (holders can vote on allocation percentages)
- Urgent needs (emergency response to natural disasters or other crises)
- Strategic partnerships (long-term support for high-impact initiatives)

### Transparency Reporting

Pet Coin AI is committed to full transparency in its charitable
operations:

- All charity wallet addresses are publicly verified and monitored
- Monthly reports detail donation amounts and recipients
- Quarterly impact assessments showcase the real-world effects of
  donations
- Annual audits verify the proper allocation of all charitable funds

Through this transparent charity mechanism, Pet Coin AI creates a direct
link between cryptocurrency transactions and real-world impact for
animals in need, allowing holders to track exactly how their activity
supports animal welfare initiatives.
