# Companion Network Unit (CNU)

**Companion Network Unit (CNU)** is a purpose-driven ERC-20 token and staking ecosystem built on Ethereum (and tested on Sepolia) that combines blockchain technology with meaningful real-world impact. Every transaction supports animal welfare through automatic donations, burns, and user rewards. This repo contains the core Solidity contracts, test suite, deployment tools, and Uniswap integration code for the project.

## 🌍 What Is CNU?

Companion Network Unit (ticker: `CNU`) is a hybrid utility and charity token designed to:

- Fund animal rescue and welfare organizations via **automatic fee routing**
- Reward long-term holders with **staking incentives and tier-based benefits**
- Provide **on-chain transparency and migration safety** via upgradeable vault logic
- Back its economy with a **Uniswap V3-based price oracle** used for access control and valuation

Tokenomics include:
- 🔥 **0.5% burn**
- 🐶 **1% charity fee**
- 🎁 **2% rewards** to the staking vault

## 🧱 Components

This monorepo includes:

### Solidity Contracts

| Contract             | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CNU.sol`      | The core ERC-20 token with fee mechanics, vault routing, pause control |
| `TreasuryVault.sol` | Bulk CNU storage for treasury payouts, claims, and migrations          |
| `StakingVault.sol`   | Multi-stake reward vault with tiered lock durations and finalization   |
| `CharityVault.sol`   | Donation receiver, distributor, and migratable charity sink            |
| `UniswapV3PriceFeed.sol` | TWAP-based price oracle for CNU from a Uniswap V3 pool            |
| `AccessGating.sol`   | Role-based gating using USD-valued CNU holdings                      |

### Test Suite

Powered by **Hardhat** and **Chai**, with deep coverage for:

- Token economics and exemptions
- Vault migration logic and fee forwarding
- Oracle behavior (TWAP, TOO_SOON, fallback handling)
- Gating logic and tier thresholds
- Reward distribution and edge case handling

### Tasks

Custom `hardhat` tasks for:

- Deploying contracts (`deploy-core`)
- Creating Uniswap V3 pools (`create-pair`)
- Adding liquidity via V3 position manager (`add-liquidity`)
- Wiring price feeds and updating TWAPs (`deploy-feed`, `update-feed`)
- Checking on-chain state (`status`, `balance`)

## 🔧 Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
````

### Build & Compile Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Run Local Tests

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### Deploy to Sepolia

Configure `.env`:

```env
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://...
PRIVATE_WALLET_KEY=0x...
```

Then: 
For local development, just use local hardhat node!
(don't specifiy the network)

```bash
npx hardhat deploy-core --network sepolia
```

Add a Uniswap V3 pool (CNU/quote):

```bash
npx hardhat create-pair --network sepolia
npx hardhat add-liquidity --network sepolia
```

Link and update price feed:

```bash
npx hardhat deploy-feed --pool 0xYourPool --network sepolia
npx hardhat update-feed --network sepolia
```

For non-WETH quotes (USDC, GNO, etc.), pass `--quote` on pool/liquidity/swap tasks and ensure `deployed.json` has `quote` set to that token. Use `--amountQuote` with the quote token’s decimals.

---

## 📊 Governance and Access

CNU holders receive **Access Tiers** based on their USD-equivalent holdings using Uniswap TWAP pricing. If your quote token is not USD-pegged (e.g. WETH), set thresholds accordingly or use a USD quote pool.

| Tier     | Threshold (USD) |
| -------- | --------------- |
| CLUB     | \$1             |
| SILVER   | \$100           |
| GOLD     | \$500           |
| PLATINUM | \$1,000         |
| DIAMOND  | \$10,000        |
